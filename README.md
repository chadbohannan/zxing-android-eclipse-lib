This project is a brutal fork of zxing for android in eclipse. Lots of edits to make the code Java 1.6 compliant. The zxing project uses Java 1.7

It makes a single jar file, which you can nab from the bin directory if that is all you need.

If you want to use the source tree in a library you probably want to subclass com.google.zxing.android.CaptureActivity.
